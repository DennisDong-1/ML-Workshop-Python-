# Polymorphism -> f concept in oop, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass ( have many forms/faces )
# Two ways -> 
#   1. Inheritance - an object could be treated as of the same type as a parent class
#   2. Duck typing - object must have necessary attributes/methods
